/*
 * Lock-less NULL terminated single linked list
 *
 * If there are multiple producers and multiple consumers, llist_add
 * can be used in producers and llist_del_all can be used in
 * consumers.  They can work simultaneously without lock.  But
 * llist_del_first can not be used here.  Because llist_del_first
 * depends on list->first->next does not changed if list->first is not
 * changed during its operation, but llist_del_first, llist_add,
 * llist_add (or llist_del_all, llist_add, llist_add) sequence in
 * another consumer may violate that.
 *
 * If there are multiple producers and one consumer, llist_add can be
 * used in producers and llist_del_all or llist_del_first can be used
 * in the consumer.
 *
 * This can be summarized as follow:
 *
 *           |   add    | del_first |  del_all
 * add       |    -     |     -     |     -
 * del_first |          |     L     |     L
 * del_all   |          |           |     -
 *
 * Where "-" stands for no lock is needed, while "L" stands for lock
 * is needed.
 *
 * The list entries deleted via llist_del_all can be traversed with
 * traversing function such as llist_for_each etc.  But the list
 * entries can not be traversed safely before deleted from the list.
 * The order of deleted entries is from the newest to the oldest added
 * one.  If you want to traverse from the oldest to the newest, you
 * must reverse the order by yourself before traversing.
 *
 * The basic atomic operation of this list is cmpxchg on long.  On
 * architectures that don't have NMI-safe cmpxchg implementation, the
 * list can NOT be used in NMI handlers.  So code that uses the list in
 * an NMI handler should depend on CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_NMI_SAFE_CMPXCHG.
